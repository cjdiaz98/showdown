FUTURE BOT IMPROVEMENTS:
- implement memory of the user's playstyle and use it to make decisions
- implement a bot that will attempt reads on the opponent
- account for the current pokemon being trapped
- incentivize it to use hazards and status moves if advantageous
- incentivize to setup if advantageous (e.g. start dragon dancing)
- take into account other conditions (e.g. weather, terrain, etc.)
- trick room
- stat matchups. E.g. more likely to switch a physical wall into a physical attacker (we can use pokedex for this)
- miscellaneous considerations (e.g. not being able to use prankster moves on dark types)

This transformation boosts the power of moves that match the new Tera Type and can give strategic advantages in battles.
Terastallizing lasts until the battle ends, and only one pokemon can terastallize per battle.
This allows for flexibility in type matchups and can be used offensively or defensively depending on the situation."""

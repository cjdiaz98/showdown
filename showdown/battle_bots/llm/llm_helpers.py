FUTURE BOT IMPROVEMENTS:
- implement memory of the user's playstyle and use it to make decisions
- implement a bot that will attempt reads on the opponent
- account for the current pokemon being trapped
- incentivize it to use hazards and status moves if advantageous
- incentivize to setup if advantageous (e.g. start dragon dancing)
- take into account other conditions (e.g. weather, terrain, etc.)
- trick room
- stat matchups. E.g. more likely to switch a physical wall into a physical attacker (we can use pokedex for this)
- miscellaneous considerations (e.g. not being able to use prankster moves on dark types)
